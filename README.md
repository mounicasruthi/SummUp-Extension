# SummUp Chrome Extension

## Inspiration

The SummUp Chrome extension was inspired by the need to help people quickly and easily digest the information contained in news articles, research papers, and other long-form text. Many people find it time-consuming and overwhelming to read through entire articles, especially when they need to consume a lot of information on a regular basis. SummUp was designed to provide a solution to this problem by automatically generating concise and informative summaries of the content on a web page.

## What it does?

The SummUp Chrome extension is a powerful tool that extracts the text from a web page and generates a summary of the most important information. To use the extension, simply navigate to the web page you want to summarize, and click on the SummUp icon in your browser's toolbar. The extension uses OpenAI APIs to analyze the text on the page and extract the most important information, while leaving out extraneous details and filler text. The summary generated by SummUp is typically just a few sentences long, making it easy to read and digest quickly.

In addition to generating summaries, SummUp also has a feature that allows users to ask the extension a question based on the text content of the page. Simply click on the SummUp icon in your browser's toolbar, type in your question, and the extension will use NLP techniques to find the answer within the article text.


## Local setup guidelines
To install and run the SummUp Chrome extension locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable developer mode by clicking on the toggle switch in the upper-right corner of the page.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you cloned the repository.
5. The SummUp extension should now be installed in your browser and can be accessed by clicking on the SummUp icon in your browser's toolbar.

That's it! You should now be able to use the SummUp Chrome extension to generate summaries of web pages and ask the extension questions based on the article text directly from your browser.
